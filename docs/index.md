# :boom: Hello!

I'm a Python AI Developer with 5+ years of experience. Tools I love to use are [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic), [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), [Marvin](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [SQLModel](https://github.com/tiangolo/sqlmodel), [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer)

We are big fans of [Tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo) as he is the creator of 3 of my favorite libraries for Python (FastAPI, SQLModel, Typer).
